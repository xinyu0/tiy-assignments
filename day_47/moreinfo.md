####BACKGROUND
Earth Day Network (EDN) is an organization whose goals are to educate the public about climate change, the importance of sustainability, and how we can reduce our carbon footprint or resolve local environmental issues. With its 45th anniversary coming up this month, they have launched its 2015 campaign website themed “It’s Our Turn to Lead.”  
Although Earth Day is the world’s largest civic observance, their campaign website doesn’t reflect the importance of its message and it doesn’t motivate people coming to the site to take actions.

Explore a palette that incorporates green but try to make it more exciting.
