####Earth Day Website Redesign

####CLIENT
Earth Day Network

####BACKGROUND
Earth Day is probably the most well-known civic observance in the world. Earth Day Network (EDN) is an organization that educates the public about climate change and the importance of sustainability. With its 45th anniversary coming up this month, they have launched its 2015 campaign website themed “It’s Our Turn to Lead.”  

Despite its influence, the original website really looked horrible, something that provided Earth Day 2015 with a web presence and not much more. The site is very difficult to navigate, and it's very confusing to the users as what actions to take.   

####GOALS FOR THE REDESIGN

1. Make the site more appealing to its younger audience  
2. Deploy UI’s with a more consistent look and feel to make things be more consistent.  
3. Keep the content clear and concise from beginning to end.
4. Use context to compel users to action.

####TARGET AUDIENCE   

People from all walks of life who care about environmental issues  

Students  

Educators

####MESSAGE  

Now is our turn to lead. Everyone of us can take a stand to protect the earth, so that together, we can build more sustainable earth for ourselves and the next generation.

####SWOT ANALYSIS  

#####Strengths

#####Weakness  

Overall, the 2015 campaign website looks unorganized. There is no consistency in font and color choices. Everything looks randomly picked.

#####Game Plan  

Rebuild the following: Home, About, Program, Event, and Resource pages  

Explore a palette that incorporates green but try to make it more exciting.  

Rebrand EDN, maybe create different tones for the Resource page. Create a cool vibe targeting the college students, and possibly create an animal mascot for the K-12 students; making learning environmental stuff more interesting.
