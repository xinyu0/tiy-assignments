####Earth Day 2015 Website Redesign

####CLIENT
Earth Day Network

####BACKGROUND
Earth Day Network (EDN) is an organization whose goals are to educate the public about climate change, the importance of sustainability, and how we can reduce our carbon footprint or resolve local environmental issues. With its 45th anniversary coming up this month, they have launched its 2015 campaign website themed “It’s Our Turn to Lead.”  
Although Earth Day is the world’s largest civic observance, their 2015 website is neither motivational or inspiring. The site is very difficult to navigate, and it's very confusing to the users as what actions to take.   

####OBJECTIVE  

To revamp Earth Day Network’s 2015 campaign website to attract more individuals and organizations to get involved and be passionate about celebrating Earth Day.

####TARGET AUDIENCE   

People from all walks of life who care about environmental issues  

Students  

Educators

####MESSAGE  

Now is our turn to lead. Everyone of us can take a stand to protect the earth, so that together, we can build more sustainable earth for ourselves and the next generation.

####COMPETITION  

Sierra Club  

World Wildlife Fund

####SWOT ANALYSIS  

#####Strengths  

EDN is very well-known. Its brand has presences in 192 countries. 

#####Weakness  

Overall, the 2015 campaign website looks unorganized. There is no consistency in font and color choices. Everything looks randomly picked.

#####Game Plan  

Rebuild the following: Home, About, Program, Event, and Resource pages  

Explore a palette that incorporates green but try to make it more exciting.  

Rebrand EDN, maybe create different tones for the Resource page. Create a cool vibe targeting the college students, and possibly create an animal mascot for the K-12 students; making learning environmental stuff more interesting.
