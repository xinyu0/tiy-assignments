####BACKGROUND
Earth Day Network (EDN) is an organization whose goals are to educate the public about climate change, the importance of sustainability, and how we can reduce our carbon footprint or resolve local environmental issues. With its 45th anniversary coming up this month, they have launched its 2015 campaign website themed “It’s Our Turn to Lead.” Although Earth Day is the world’s largest civic observance, their campaign website doesn’t reflect the importance of its message and it doesn’t motivate people coming to the site to take actions.   

####OBJECTIVE  

To revamp Earth Day Network’s 2015 campaign website to attract more individuals and organizations to get involved and pass along the importance of protecting the earth.

####TARGET AUDIENCE   

People from all walks of life
Students

Explore a palette that incorporates green but try to make it more exciting.
Rebrand EDN, maybe create different tones for the “Learn” page. Create a cool vibe targeting the college students, and possibly create an animal mascot for the K-12 students; making learning environmental stuff more interesting
